This is a do-it-yourself preparation event, i.e., it’s assumed that you're familiar with camping and know what to bring along, including meals. This trip is suitable for someone who is comfortable at the least with car camping and can carry 25-40 lbs backpack for a roundtrip of 11 miles with about 500’ of elevation change. Maybe try out a short hike prior to that weekend with a full backpack, including food for 1.5 days and 2 ltrs of water. You would also need full camping gear including a warm sleeping bag and sleeping pad (equally important). Sandals/ flip flops, board shorts, and swim wear is optional and beach towels might be a tad heavy to carry. Also be prepared with layers as it sometimes gets windy at the campgrounds.</p> <p>Cost: $10. We'll have bonfire at the beach unless it's a Spare The Air day. Campground has a toilet, garbage bins, and water faucet.</p> <p>Following trail etiquette, including Leave No Trace, and team camaraderie is mandatory for this event. Special treats for organizers are highly encouraged;)</p> <p>*Add yourself to the waitlist and I will do a lottery in a few days from the people who are shortlisted based on a mix of following criteria - prior climbing/hiking with me, with NorCal Hikers, and hiking/climbing experience. You will have 24 hrs to confirm by making the payment. Will share trip planning doc with the confirmed people.</p> <p>And now, the standard disclaimer.</p> <p>NorCal Hikers Refund Policy (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/norcalhikers/pages/Refund_Policy\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/norcalhikers/pages/Refund_Policy</a>)</p> <p>Disclaimer (<a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/5803182/NorCal%20Event%20Disclaimer.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://files.meetup.com/5803182/NorCal%20Event%20Disclaimer.pdf</a>)</p> <p>This following link has a detailed checklist of backpacking items for your reference so that you can make your own judgment call.

Following trail etiquette, including Leave No Trace, and team camaraderie is mandatory for my events. I reserve the right to forbid a select few people from attending, mainly based on the following criteria from prior events - adherence to Leave No Trace, team camaraderie (doing their own thing or going too slow/fast relative to the whole group), or bailing out last minute.

Besides being the answer to most interview questions, an algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem in programming.</p> <p>Google Maps uses an algorithm to calculate driving directions through 3 cities while avoiding highways. Amazon uses an algorithm to figure out exactly what product to recommend to you next so that you'll blindly one-click it.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will discuss what an algorithm is, introduce the idea of algorithmic complexity (big O notation), demonstrate sort and search algorithms (with a hands-on re-enactment), and finish with an overview of the many types of algorithms out there.</p> <p>This workshop focuses on design-thinking for algorithms, which is a pre-requisite to expressing these ideas in code. It will be taught by Christina Foran, Software Engineer at Slack, and Kristin Mayer, Software Engineer at CoderPad.</p> <p>Topics covered:<br/>• Defining an algorithm<br/>• Data structures<br/>• Time/space complexity<br/>• Several sorting algorithms<br/>• Binary search<br/>• Algorithms in real life</p> <p>Slides: <a href=\"http://www.teaching-materials.org/algorithms/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.teaching-materials.org/algorithms/</a></p> <p>Prerequisites: Attendees would benefit from a basic understanding of a programming language, like from JS 101, but that is not required.</p> <p>Tech requirements:<br/>• Your laptop with a charger<br/>• A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)</p> <p>If you do not have a laptop, please contact the instructor.

We make sure that the swimmers keep their heads above water, connect with the coach (Coach Joey), stay safe, and most importantly, have fun. The pool is stocked with plenty of inflatable shimshams - balls, noodles, toys, etc to help athletes take part in different activities in the pool.</p> <p>The session starts with an orientation at 11:30, the kids arrive at 11:45 and it finishes at 12:45. The pool provides a locker room and lifeguard, all you need is a towel. Volunteers are also encouraged to do a few laps after the session is over.</p> <p>There's street parking in the area, but remember it's North Beach so parking can be difficult. Sundays are better and I've been able to find parking within a few blocks of the pool.</p> <p>So that everybody has a safe and fun time in the pool, we'd like to ask:</p> <p>• females wear a t-shirt over your swimsuit</p> <p>• always keep your athlete to the front of you</p> <p>• arrive early to park</p> <p>• bring your suit &amp; towel</p> <p>• &amp; have fun!!</p> <p>If you're interested, we can grab a bite to eat afterwards.

But *writing* concurrent programs is complicated, intimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts.</p> <p>Does it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and straightforward too? I think so. By carefully analyzing usability pitfalls in other libraries, and taking advantage of new Python 3 features, I've come up with a new set of primitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs, and implemented them in a new library called [Trio](<a href=\"https://trio.readthedocs.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://trio.readthedocs.io</a>). In this talk, I'll describe these primitives, and demonstrate how to use them to implement a basic algorithm for speeding up</p> <p>Bio: Nathaniel J. Smith is a cognitive scientist and open-source developer, currently at the UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science. He's a core developer on NumPy and CPython, brought the '@' operator to Python, co-designed matplotlib's \"viridis\" colormap, instigated the creation of \"manylinux\" wheels, and writes too many PEPs. He won't be talking about any of that.</p> <p>— Nim for Python programmers, by Abhishek Kapatkar</p> <p>Ever wondered if there existed a language as expressive as Python and as efficient as C/C++? Look no further then. Nim is a statically typed, compiled language with a focus on efficiency. It is versatile and borrows much of its constructs and standard library design from Python <a href=\"https://nim-lang.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://nim-lang.org</a></p> <p>Bio: Abhishek Kapatkar works at Netflix on Machine learning infrastructure team, whose mission is to make using data easy and efficient. He and his team are responsible for envisioning how the data platform allows data scientists to make Netflix's service even better. He enjoys product development, programming language design, and is passionate about the usage of technology for the social good and currently serves as a San Francisco chapter leader for Datakind.org.</p> <p><br/>AGENDA:</p> <p>6:00p - Check-in and mingle, with food provided by our generous sponsor Yelp!</p> <p>7:05p - Welcome</p> <p>7:10p - Announcements, lightning talks, and main talk</p> <p>7:30p - Doors Close</p> <p>8:20p - More mingling</p> <p>9:30p - Hard Stop</p> <p>**SF Python is run by volunteers aiming to foster the Python Community in the bay area.

No experience is needed, and we also welcome people who aren’t Sierra Club members.

Wear closed-toed shoes, clothes that you won’t mind getting dirty, and a hat for sun protection; bring your own water and a snack. We will provide the pruning tools and gloves, but please bring your own tools and gloves if you have them.</p> <p>How: Use proper tools to shorten or remove branches selectively. Then pile the removed branches together along the curb so they don't intrude on the sidewalk. (Don't worry; we'll teach you whatever you don't know.) Other Sierra Club helpers will remove the piles of branches afterward.</p> <p>Where: *** To be determined. *** We'll update this page when we've chosen the real location.

Headlamps or flashlights recommended for short sections of the trail but the objective is to enjoy hiking in the moonlight with no or very limited artificial illumination. Level: Moderate ++ (2C) Not a beginner’s hike as this hike will be difficult for new hikers, hikers out of shape or those with phobias about hiking at night. We will stop on a regular basis but must complete the hike by 10pm when the park closes. This means we have 3.5 hours to complete a 7 mile hike with significant elevation gain. If you are unsure about your physical condition, please hike another day where the time required to complete the hike is not an issue. Exiting the park after 10pm can lead to a misdemeanor charge of trespassing by EBRPD.</p> <p>Estimated Distance of Hike: Seven + miles</p> <p>Gross Elevation Gain: 2100 ft.</p> <p>Parking Cost: $ 4.00 parking fee if you park in the Ohlone College multi story garage. Free if you park on Mission Blvd. and walk onto campus. If you park off campus, walk up Pine Street until you see the multi-story garage on your left. It is the building that has multi-floors and looks like a parking garage. We will meet across the street at the trail head.</p> <p>Bring: Two liters of water, lamp, snack, layered clothing, and enthusiasm. Recommend well-fitting boots for traction and ankle support. Hiking poles may be helpful.</p> <p>Cancellation: Activity is held rain or cloudy weather, but may be altered due to snow or hail.</p> <p>Carpool: We recommend you arrange your own carpools where it is most convenient for you. The nearest BART station is the Fremont Warm Springs BART Station. Meet: Entrance to the park - above the tennis courts at the Ohlone College trailhead to the Peak Trail. Park entrance is across the street from the parking structure located at the end of Pine Street.</p> <p>Directions: Ohlone College is located in the City of Fremont on Mission Blvd.</p> <p>Trail Map <a href=\"http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/directions/tofremont.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/directions/tofremont.html</a></p> <p>Ohlone Parking Structure: <a href=\"http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/parking/parkingstructure.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/parking/parkingstructure.html</a></p> ",

            "description": "<p>• What we'll do<br/>Hike the steep and great views in this overlooked, but huge regional park of Black Diamond, and after the hike get the FREE mine tour with Regional Park experts.<br/>A fantastic winter hiking area. This is when the grass is green, and lures out the cows, the Inner East Bay area enjoys cool, brisk weather, the views are great and the hiking trails phenomenal. From the parking lot we will begin our first uphill along the River View Trail to our first summit from Saddle Trail to see across the inland valley, then we continue to the Ridge trail until we come to the steep descent of Cocoran Mine Trail. When we reach to bottom, we will take a short detour to Prospect Tunnel ( a small dark shaft, that was abandoned), for those who want to explore the short tunnel (200 feet) I suggest a flashlight or headlamp. Here, we will take a short water and snack break of 15 minutes or so. Then we take the main Stewartsville Townsite Trail back along the valley floor before we take the steep and winding Miners trail back to the Ridge line and then our last descent to the parking lot. Where we will walk over to the Mine Shaft and get in line for the first tour of the day which begins at 12pm</p> <p>This is a 7 mile hike with elevation gain over 1600 feet.</p> <p>This is a great area to explore the old mining towns of Sommerville, Stewartville, Nortonville, West Hartley and Judsonville. Towns that once thrived with coal mining went extinct with industrial changes and ranching, and bad quality of coal with increased productions costs. The Hazel-Atlas was the last surviving mine since it went from coal, to silicone mining for making your famous glass mason jars. After the hike, we will line up for the FREE (only do 4 a year and this one is the first) Park Sponsored tour of the Hazel Atlas Mine. You will get to see the machinery used to dig these honeycombed tunnels, learn about working conditions, and ask questions to the many park officials they usually have on hand for these tours. Usually the first group also gets free t-shirts, pins or hats.<br/>The tour is self-guided with park officials in many areas to inform you of what you are looking at. I have also been informed by the park that they opened up another section of the tunnels and they are excited to show it to visitors. Plus, my favorite is that you also get to see what a fault line looks like inside the tunnel. The tour usually takes about 90 minutes depending upon how many people are on line and how long you wish to linger and learn from the park officials.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Bring 1-2 liters water, snacks, poles optional for those who like the extra stability over steep ascent and descents, and a sense of fun.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>$5.00 parking fee.<br/>No dogs on this hike please</p> <p>PLEASE READ BEFORE RSVP-ING TO A HIKE:</p> <p>• Ensure that this hike is the right level of difficulty for you.

In nonchronological fashion, the novel covers more than 30 years in the lives of a group of upper-middle-class English friends, especially Anthony Beavis and his longtime married lover, Helen. His intense prep-school friendships continue at Oxford; most important are his relationships with Brian Foxe, who later commits suicide; with Hugh Ledwidge, who marries Helen; and with Mark Staithes, who becomes a Marxist and with whom Beavis goes to Mexico to fight in a revolution. While in Mexico, Beavis adopts a Buddhist-centered philosophy, practices meditation, and becomes a pacifist. Written at the height of his powers immediately after Brave New World, Aldous Huxley's highly acclaimed Eyeless in Gaza is his most personal novel.<br/>Suggested by: Charlie</p> <p>MEETING FORMAT</p> <p>Book discussion meetings combine free-flowing conversation about the book, led by one volunteer, and information of interest about the book delivered via an informal presentation, led by another volunteer. The following is the East Bay Book Club's meeting format:</p> <p>1. Introduction of all attendees<br/>2. Biographical information about the author (no more than 10 minutes) and facts of interest about the book (no more than 10 minutes), all presented by the first volunteer<br/>3. Comments and thoughts on the book (approximately one hour), shared spontaneously or in response to discussion questions that the second volunteer writes or compiles<br/>4. Final thoughts on the book from all attendees (no more than one minute per attendee)</p> <p>If you would like to volunteer for either the author/book presentation or the discussion questions, please leave a comment below stating which role you would like to volunteer for. The Organizer and Co-Organizers will, if possible, make efforts to email everyone to ask for volunteers if needed. It is strongly encouraged that people who plan to attend the meeting consider volunteering to ensure the best possible book discussion experience.</p> <p>REMINDER ABOUT MEMBERSHIP FEE</p> <p>The East Bay Book Club charges a $5 membership fee that is good for one year. The fee, which is paid by cash or check, is due any time before the second meeting you attend after joining the club or after your previous membership expired. As the Organizer or Co-Organizer does roll call, he/she will check your membership status and let you know if and when a fee is due.</p> ",

            "description": "<p>SAN FRANCISCO PREMIERE OF \"THE END OF MEAT,\" WED. MARCH 21 AT 6 PM, PLUS VEGAN DINNER</p> <p>Enjoy the San Francisco premiere of the ground-breaking German documentary, \"The End of Meat.\" This exciting movie reveals the hidden impact of meat consumption; explores the opportunities and benefits of a shift to a more compassionate diet; and raises critical questions about the future role of animals in our society.</p> <p>In Germany, home of bratwurst and schnitzel, meat is an integral part of the diet. That is, until a few years ago, when perceptions somewhat evolved. Health concerns and meat scandals led to a public debate about the ethical implications of meat consumption and the rise of plant-based diets. Meat producers launched their own vegan products; 100% vegan supermarkets opened; and almost every food manufacturer was adding and labeling vegan options. Is this the beginning of the end of meat? Are we approaching a turning point in the human-animal relationship?</p> <p>In The End of Meat, filmmaker Marc Pierschel embarks on a journey to discover what effect a post-meat world would have on the environment, the animals and ourselves. He meets Esther the Wonder Pig, who became an internet phenomenon; talks to pioneers leading the vegan movement in Germany; visits the first fully vegetarian city in India; witnesses rescued farm animals enjoying their newly found freedom; observes the future food innovators making meat and dairy without the animals, even harvesting “bacon” from the ocean and much more.</p> <p>Along with the movie, enjoy a FABULOUS, full-course vegan dinner planned and presented by an acclaimed Bay Area food professional, Patricia Allen Koot, NE, NC. All vegan, all health-supporting, cooked without oils or added sugars, and all you care to eat! Dinner includes beverages and dessert.<br/>Bring a container and take some home with you. And, enjoy healthy but yummy table snacks during the movie.</p> <p>Location is a great venue in the heart of San Francisco, the Opera Plaza Community Room, 601 Van Ness, San Francisco. Take the elevator to the mezzanine, then follow the sign down the hall to the right. A giant screen, and sound by Bose, add to the ambiance to make it a truly enjoyable experience.</p> <p>You get the premiere, and a full-course dinner, for the price of a movie ticket. Fifteen bucks, requested donation. Why? Because we are a nonprofit here to serve the community. The Nutritionist donates her time. Funds go toward facility rental, food, transport and other costs.</p> <p>RSVP to reserve your place! We expect a full house, so act now. Do so here, or email to: [masked] OR call (888)[masked]</p> <p>See you there!</p> ",

Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $8/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p> ",

            "description": "<p>San Francisco by Day has always been a very popular event and I'm happy to bring it back!  We'll be checking out the cool hidden places right in downtown San Francisco.  Wear comfortable walking shoes and dress warmly (or wear layers). We'll try to end the walking tour at 5:45pm and watch the sunset from one of the piers on Embarcadero. Then we'll head over to Palomino for drinks. </p> <p><b>***** COST: $20/person.</b> Take this 1 minute survey and get get 50% OFF, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/IFb0EuHFw3YocUlj1\"><a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/IFb0EuHFw3YocUlj1\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/IFb0EuHFw3YocUlj1</a></a> (you'll get a discount code after completion). Purchase your tickets here, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/uoP1gg\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/uoP1gg</a>. Limit 50 people (tickets not RSVP's). OR $20 CASH ONLY at the event. <b>*****</b></p> <p>We'll meet at the roof top garden (at Crocker Galleria) and let the giant compass guide us. We'll pass the upside-down rectangular-pyramid that pays homage to one of the oldest race (group of people) in history.  We'll pause at the 164 year old church (and still standing), and travel underneath a water fall. Then we'll take a break to make some oragami boats, (put your wish in them) and send them down the stream. </p> <p>Next, we'll go visit a Grand Garden Court fit for a king or queen (bring your cameras). We'll hike a bit more to discover a few more beautiful water fountains and gardens, hidden inside the city. Have you ever seen it rain indoors? We're going to see that too. Lastly, we'll end our journey on one of the pier to watch the sunset, moon rise and the lights on the Bay Bridge.  Afterwards, we can grab drinks and/or food at Palomio to end our glorious day in San Francisco. (NOTE: last time a demonstration interfered with our schedule so if that happens again we'll play it by ear and adjust our path as needed.) </p> <p>***** Approximate Schedule:  *****</p> <p>3:00 - Roof Garden above Crocker Galleria, next to the giant compass. Check-in from 3:00-3:15pm. We leave at 3:20pm. </p> <p>4:00 - Yerba Buena gardens (Mission St between 3rd &amp; 4th) </p> <p>4:45 - Market Street Plaza (Market &amp; 1st) or 560 Mission Street Plaza</p> <p>5:15 - Rincon Center, 121 Spear St (inside)(note: it closes at 5:30pm)</p> <p>5:45 - Pier 14 (off The Embarcadero x Mission St) </p> <p>6:15  - Palomino is at 345 Spear Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 </p> <p>NO EVENT CELL PHONE. If you miss the meet up time, try to find us at one of the stops above and then check-in with me.</p> <p>Directions to the Roof Garden above Crocker Galleria: when you get to the Galleria, take the escalators to the top floor. When you get off the top escalator, look to your left, in that walk way there are stairs leading up to the roof top. There is a sign that says Roof Garden but it's hard to see. Meet us at the compass structure (see photo). </p> <p>Dao</p> <p>You're invited to Friend me on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dao.nguyen.2188003\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dao.nguyen.2188003\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/dao.nguyen.2188003</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/e/f/e/600_287060222.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/b/6/highres_436034262.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/b/4/highres_436034260.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/b/d/highres_436034269.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/c/6/highres_436034278.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/c/b/highres_436034283.jpeg\" /></p> ",

We all decide on the story topics that night, so it's SPONTANEOUS! And, if you get up to tell a spontaneous story, you win a free drink ticket! Entry is FREE!</p> <p>How it works: When you enter into the bar, get an icebreaker Game Card and grab a pen. The object of the game is to talk to as many people as possible, note down their answer, and then turn it in. You'll automatically start thinking of stories as you go.</p> <p>After the icebreaker game it's time for open-mic true, personal stories on whatever themes we come up with. You're all primed to tell or just listen to others. You've already met most of the people there, so it's easy!</p> <p><br/>It's really fun, you'll meet a ton of people and get to know them in a little more interesting way than if you were just at a happy hour mixer.</p> <p>The game is optional.<br/>Telling a story is optional.<br/>Drinking is optional.<br/>Having a good time = not optional!<br/>See you on the 1st Saturday!</p> ",

Why would anyone trust the trends that came out of an eight-person qualitative study? Frances James has made a career out of studying people and demonstrating the value of qualitative research within businesses. She'll explain what UX Research is, some of the methods that are typically used, and her approach to working cross-functionally. She'll also share practical examples of actionable insights that can come from these types of studies.</p> <p>About Frances James:<br/>Frances has 10+ years of career experience in UX Research at various agencies and companies. Most recently she led mobile UX research at Netflix. Before becoming a Senior Manager of UX Research at Netflix, she was a Senior User Researcher at Zynga and a UX Lead at Bolt Peters, a UX research and design firm. She graduated from Georgia State University with a Masters in Cognitive Psychology.

If you’re a human being, there are multiple cultures you both represent and that you interact with on a daily basis.

It's applications are many - if you’ve re-located to or are native to the San Francisco Bay Area, if you're a world traveler, assessing world news or even just riding BART ... Our CQ can always be improved.</p> <p>Behavioral Enthusiasts:<br/>Building community and creating engaged open, respectful, discussion is the intention for this event. If you’re interested in the topic, and meeting others, please come, even if you haven’t read the material. Every Behavioral Enthusiast has their own personal expertise in this subject.</p> <p>Discussion Catalysts*:<br/>o What is Cultural Intelligence?<br/>o The Four Factors of Cultural Intelligence<br/>o The 10 cultural value dimensions<br/>o Applying &amp; Improving CQ - in ourselves, others and society<br/>*Handouts will be available for all topics.</p> <p>“Everybody assumes that Cultural Intelligence comes from understanding other people’s cultures and the further I went the more I began to realize there was the one most difficult culture of them all to crunch which is your own. That’s the culture you really have to understand. Understand when it helps you and understand when it hinders you. Understand when it opens things up for you, when it closes things down; when it causes other people problems; when it gives you knots and when it misses you opportunities.” -Julia Middleton, TedTalk</p> <p>Book: Leading with Cultural Intelligence Master the One Skill You Can’t Do Without in Today’s Global Economy by David Livermore</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Your openness and curiosity:-)</p> ",

It was an enlightening and FUN discussion so I'm doing it again :-) There are already 4 women signed up offline so my hope is to get 4 guys signed up for a balanced gender view. Please be comfortable sharing your best/worst stories, as well as, having your profile reviewed for revisions and willingness to provide feedback on other's profiles. We're a gentle, but rambunctious crew :-)</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Since it will be a Sunday evening, we'll make it a light potluck. I'll provide adult beverages and some nibbles to share. Please supplement with items that you enjoy and bring enough for 8.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This is super casual. It's truly to provide support and perspective on the dating scene in the Bay Area. You will not walk away enlightened, but you will enjoy yourself ;-) Don't sign up unless you're 100% confident you can attend!</p> ",

            "description": "<p>All, I am very happy to have invited three speakers to talk about experimentation and Visualizing Food Insecurity. Note: Udemy requires to sign NDAs for all attendees</p> <p>Talk 1: Online Experimentation at Scale</p> <p>Large scale, online experimentation has a different set of problems then those addressed in typical academic experimentation or statistics courses. For example, in online experimentation we typically care about small effect sizes because even a small effect can have an outsized effect on revenue. Sometimes we also want to make decisions under a high degree of uncertainty. In this talk I'll present a few of these problems and survey how companies like Optimizely and Microsoft have addressed them. Finally, I'll present an approach we're working on at Udemy that is inspired by Facebook's approach to developing a general solution to time-series problems with Prophet. That is, we are developing a generalized solution to analyzing large scale experiments that addresses some of the worries with these types of experiments while still being widely applicable off-the-shelf.</p> <p>Speaker: Robert Neal, Udemy</p> <p>Robert spent about a decade on the user side of experimentation in cognitive science. The last few years, he has been working on the statistics side designing and building experimentation systems that scale, first at Credit Karma and now at Udemy. A big part of that is finding appropriately generalizable statistical methods and ensuring that they are computationally scalable.</p> <p>Lighting Talk2: Visualize Food insecurity</p> <p>Food insecurity occurs when people do not have consistent access to affordable, nutritious food. We can make a real impact and educate others by visualizing our insights and predictions that have the most power to do social good. In this lighting talk, I will showcase an approach to do just that. I will demonstrate this with Pandas, PixieDust, and Watson Analytics.</p> <p>Speaker: Mdison Myers, IBM</p> <p>Madison J. Myers is a data scientist at the Spark Technology Center, IBM. She received her BA from NYU, her first masters from King's College London, and her second masters from UC Berkeley. While Madison previously studied global political science and worked in a think tank focusing on food policy, she is now passionate about using data science for good, particularly in the health domain.</p> <p>Talk 3 : A Philosophy for Product Experimentation, Airbnb</p> <p>When data scientists work on product teams we can easily spend all our time analyzing experiments. But is this the best way to use our time? At Airbnb it is impossible to scale our data science team linearly with our rate of experimentation. I'm excited to share how upfront research into leading indicators enabled a small team to run 40+ experiments in 2 months with only part-time data science advice. These hard-won lessons led to a successful new landing page, as well as a general philosophy: \"a hard-working data scientist is indispensable, but a wise data scientist makes themselves unnecessary.</p> <p>Speaker: Richard Dear</p> <p>Richard manages the search and discovery data science team at Airbnb, using data to improve Airbnb's online experience from first touch to the decision to book. Before Airbnb Richard worked with two mobile game startups based in Beijing. He learnt almost all his data skills on the job, and is excited about how quickly our profession continues to evolve along with our technology.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6 - 6:30 pm check-in<br/>6:30 pm -- 7:15 pm Online Experimentation at Scale<br/>7:15 pm -- 7:25 pm lighting talk: Visualize Food insecurity<br/>7:25 pm -- 8:10 pm A Philosophy for Product Experimentation<br/>8:10 pm -- 8:30 pm closing</p> ",

This session will provide a getting started guide in addition to examples of how to develop and run IoT backends as FaaS (Functions as a Service) using an API Gateway, Kubernetes, Node.js and Docker.Reference architectures and open source code samples will be provided.</p> <p>How to deploy DL models on AWS Lambda, by Rustem Feyzkhanov, Data Scientist at Astro Digital</p> <p>This year tensorflow 1.4 was finally released. I succeeded to fit it into AWS Lambda and built recognition of images trained on imagenet. Why? Given the price tag lambda one run (recognition of one picture) will cost $0.00005. That is, for a dollar you can recognize 20,000 images. It is much cheaper than almost any alternatives, though completely scalable (1000 functions can be run in parallel), and can be easily integrated into cloud infrastructure. If you have a trained model in your pocket my talk will help you to fit it into AWS Lambda.<br/>During the meetup I will also show how to start tensorflow package using serverless framework in one line of code.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>Lots of enthusiasm...</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Please enter the building on the side which is on Ringold St. The front entrance will be closed.</p> ",
